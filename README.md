# Pure Momentum 
Based upon a June, 2021 research article titled *Pure Momentun in Cryptocurrency Markets* by Cesare Fracassi and Shimon Kogan, momentum in financial markets is one of the most widespread, persistent, and puzzling phenomenon in asset pricing.  

We decided to put this research hypothesis to the test using historical hourly data for both Bitcoin and Ethereum to try and predict future movements with relevant statistical accuracy.  

## Technologies Used
We pulled historical hourly data for both Bitcoin and Ethereum from a number of exchanges.  For this project we used data from both Gemini and Yahoo Finance.  The data that we pull is then stored on a local csv file.  We then performed a regression analysis to test the thesis brought up in the research article.  

## Instructions
To run this application clone the files from github onto your PC and then run it using Jupyter Lab.  You will need the Pandas and NumPy applications from the Python library which can be installed on your PC.

# Pure Momentum 
Based upon a June, 2021 research article titled *Pure Momentun in Cryptocurrency Markets* by Cesare Fracassi and Shimon Kogan, momentum in financial markets is one of the most widespread, persistent, and puzzling phenomenon in asset pricing.  

We decided to put this research hypothesis to the test using historical hourly data for both Bitcoin and Ethereum to try and predict their future movements with relevant statistical accuracy.
